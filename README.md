# A/B Testing for E-commerce Website

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting an A/B test for an e-commerce website to determine whether a newly developed web page increases the number of users who "convert" (i.e., decide to pay for the company's product). The goal is to analyze the results and provide actionable insights to help the company decide whether to implement the new page, keep the old page, or extend the experiment duration for further analysis.

## Key Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the new web page compared to the old one.
- Determine the statistical significance of the results to guide decision-making.
- Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Data was collected from users randomly assigned to either the old page (control group) or the new page (treatment group).
2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new page has no effect on conversion rates (i.e., conversion rates for the new page are equal to or less than the old page).
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The new page has a positive effect on conversion rates (i.e., conversion rates for the new page are higher than the old page).
3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculated p-values to determine the significance of the results.
   - Analyzed interaction effects between variables.

## Results
- The p-values for all variables, including interaction terms, were **greater than 0.05**.
- None of the variables showed **statistically significant** results.
- **Conclusion**: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. The new page did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in conversion rates compared to the old page.

## Recommendations
1. **Do Not Implement the New Page**: Based on the current data, the new page does not provide a significant improvement in conversion rates.
2. **Consider Running the Experiment Longer**: If feasible, extending the duration of the experiment could provide more data and potentially reveal insights that are not apparent in the current dataset.
3. **Explore Other Strategies**: Investigate alternative approaches to improve conversion rates, such as user experience enhancements, targeted marketing campaigns, or A/B testing other page elements.
