A/B TEST 


in this project we make a A/B TEST run by an e-commerce website, The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. my goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Summary and conclusion

The p_value for both interactionmis higher than 0.05. None of the variables have significant p-values. we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. all of them is that the new page did not prove to be better than the old page.
